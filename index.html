    Steve Irwin became known for his spectacular and enthusiastically presented television program "The Crocodile Hunter". <br> Irwin owned the Australian Zoo Zoo in Beerwah. Team Klockhuys and team Muizepluis saw him there in the infamous shows where he wore a crocodile <br> while holding his one month old son Robert. We stayed with our good friend Gerda, who, although 65+ and from Almere (suburb Amsterdam), <br> soon grew into the fearless snake catcher of Tambourine Mountain. Holy cow!
